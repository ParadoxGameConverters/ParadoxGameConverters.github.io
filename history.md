# Converters History

I gave a talk at PDXCon 2021 about this, if you'd like the history in that form. You can find the recording [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1032428222?filter=highlights&sort=time).

When Crusader Kings was released, it included an exporter to Europa Universalis 2. This inspired a multiplayer group to try a campaign from CK to EU2. Rolf Andreassen (King of Men) was unsatisfied with the quality and wrote a fan-made converter. Around the same time, Chaingun created an EU2 to Vic converter, which later saw signficant improvements from montyP.

When the multiplayer group began their campaign, they also wrote After Action Reports (AARs) for it, creating the first megacampaign AAR. Portions of is can be read on [King of Men's webpage](https://sites.google.com/site/komskustomkonverters/aars) or on the [Paradox forums](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-great-game-mp-aar.197420/).

When Victoria was given the expansion Revolutions, it contined an exporter to HoI2, allowing an automated campaign across the four major works in Paradox's portfolio. As sequels were released to the different games, different fans created converters to match. This has continued to the modern day, with most converters now done by a coordinated team.

An early version of EU3 to Vic2 inspired a [humorous review](https://lparchive.org/Victoria-II-Heart-of-Darkness/Update%2019/), leading to the idea of Secret Denmark. The converters team quickly added it as an easter egg. later Paradox would do the same.

Over the years, many AARs and LPs have been released in many places: Something Awful, the Paradox Forums, Youtube, Reddit, and more. Known works are recorded below.

## Secret Denmark
Secret Denmark is based on a EU4 to Vic2 conversion, but from early in the converter, when it still had a lot of EU3 to Vic2 code. The post (by Patter Song) was laughing at the resulting jank.

EU3 to Vic2 made a save, so relied on existing Vic2 tags. It was clever, tried to directly assign (Spain to Spain), regionally assign (Castille might convert to Portugal), use general leftover, and finally dip into the dynamic Vic2 tags. Many countries would be correct, but others would be very strange. Lots of “Mighty <region>”, “Strong <region>”, “The Federation <of region>”, “Secret <region>”, etc. The converter broke those to drop the region part, of course.

Vic2 with expansions was an early experiment in clever names printed on the map. Over your own territory, it would print your own name. Over other territory it would try to be more descriptive (useful in an age of colonialism). How did it tell the difference? Cores! In land with your own cores, it just puts your name. In areas without your cores, but someone else’s it prints <Your adjective> <other county name>, giving names like British Canada.

Putting those together, the converter gave a bunch of cores to Denmark, which was a dead country, including tags in Greenland. The actual country controlling Greenland (and parts of Canada) was Secret. So then Greenland gets marked as ‘Secret Denmark’. Sadly the original post doesn’t directly screenshot this.
